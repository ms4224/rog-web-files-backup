# RoyOGannonWeb - BACKUP

This is a backup of the roy-o-gannon twich props website.  Small side project to create twitch streaming props.  The website keeps track of which opponent team roy-o-gannon is currently facing on super smash bros online, as well as keeps records of every match we have done.

You can view the original website here: http://roy-o-gannon.herokuapp.com/

#PLEASE NOTE!!
1. I have removed server urls from the code, so running the project locally will not work.  This is just a backup I will occasionally make public for people who request to view the code.
2. THIS SITE WAS BUILT FOR LARGE SCREENS (laptop).  Running on LOCAL will have a BUG IN THE NAVIGATION MENU.
